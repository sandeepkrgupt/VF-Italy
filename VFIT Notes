componentDidMount() -> It is invoked immediately after a component is mounted.
componentDidMount is where an AJAX request should be made in a React component. 
This method will be executed when the component
“mounts” (is added to the DOM) for the first time. This method is only executed once during the component’s life cycle.
you can perform task like - opening a popup window.

componentDidMount() {
        const {
            handleModalClose
        } = this.props;         
        ExternalizeComponent.externalizeComponent(this.externalExecuteMethods.handleModalCancel, {
            functionCallback: () => {
                return handleModalClose();
            }
        });
    }
    
render() {
        const {handleModalClose} = this.props;
        return (
            <Modal config={this.getModalConfig()}>
                <ModalHeader config={this.getHeaderConfig()} handleButtonClick={handleModalClose} />
            </Modal>
        );
    }

Display dates relative to "now".
Pluralize labels in strings.
Support for 150+ languages.
Runs in the browser and Node.js.
Built on standards
-----------------------
React Router DOM :- DOM bindings for React Router.
----------------------
webpack -
webpack is a module bundler. Its main purpose is to bundle JavaScript files for usage in a browser, 
yet it is also capable of transforming, bundling, or packaging just about any resource or asset.
----------------------

Mocha Test Case :-
Mocha is a feature-rich JavaScript test framework running on Node.js and in the browser,
making asynchronous testing simple and fun. Mocha tests run serially, 
allowing for flexible and accurate reporting, while mapping uncaught exceptions to the correct test cases.
----------------------
Chai for writing Test Case :-
Chai is an assertion library, similar to Node's built-in assert. 
It makes testing much easier by giving you lots of assertions you can run against your code
var chai = require('chai');  
var assert = chai.assert;    // Using Assert style
var expect = chai.expect;    // Using Expect style
var should = chai.should();  // Using Should style
--------------------
Enzyme :-
Enzyme is a JavaScript Testing utility for React that makes it easier to test your React Components' output. 
You can also manipulate, traverse, and in some ways simulate runtime given the output.
-------------------
Eslint :-
ESLint is a tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code. 
In many ways, it is similar to JSLint and JSHint
Feature:-
ESLint is completely pluggable, every single rule is a plugin and you can add more at runtime.
Example:-
{
    "rules": {
        "semi": ["error", "always"],
        "quotes": ["error", "double"]
    }
}
